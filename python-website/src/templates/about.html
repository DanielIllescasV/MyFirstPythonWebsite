<h1>About</h1>
<p style="color:white;">This is a basic website, created following Fazt's Web instructional video on Youtube named "Your first Website using Python". It was created as my first developer project after learning the basics from Python's structures and syntax for programming, and for me to put those skills into practical use for Web development, as I created a basic but fully functional Website completely from scratch using Python (python3) and Flask (framework for Web applications). Also, for the final stage of this project, I deployed this simple apllication on the internet using a cloud application platform named "Heroku".</p>
<p style="color:white;">The purpose of creating this simple Web application was to get familiar with Python code interacting with HTML and CSS files in order to create a basic Website, and to deploy it on a functional server online. Flask works as the Web Framework for this one, as it allowed me to simply code step by step the application, it's templates and index from start to finish using purely Pyhton and HTML code.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Finally, this little piece of work is my first ever Website created in the programming world, and it will forever serve as a reminder of where I began in this challenging but deeply rewarding Python develpment journey, where I come from, and as a starting point for all the progress, adventures and accomplishments for the brightest future hopefully is about to come...</p>
